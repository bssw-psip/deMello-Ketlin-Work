
Review Questionnaire for PSIP Practice Guide

What did you like about the practice guide? What did you not like?

The practice guide is straightforward regarding what PSIP is, why use it, and when to use it,
what makes the nature and complexity of it clear to teams planning to adopt it in a project.
I like the fact that the Step 1 instructions provide the chance to recognize bottlenecks or 
possible roadblocks that haven't been identified yet as one of the possible problems that may 
be causing deficiencies to the project. If this step is developed with the entire team, it can lead
to an agreed-upon of practices to be changed or continued while avoiding disagreement or misunderstanding of future goals.
The IDEAS-ECP and PSIP: An Illustrated Companion should be available inside that practice guide repository. It is a good source
to be used during a team meeting to introduce the idea.



Are there any parts of the practice guide that are hard to follow or that need to be restructured?

We could have a link at the end of step 8 to direct to the PTC examples (minor item to be restructured).



Do you have any recommendations for how to improve the practice guide?

The PTC Catalog could be indexed by issue, as a straightforward way to help teams to find the PTCs that are
related to their needs. The current way to identify relevant PTCs is by goal description, but for some PTCs,
there is missing data, vague descriptions, or final goals that comprehend more issues addressed  along the way.
It is still easy to identify the topics of the PTCs right now, but once the catalog increase in 
volume of contributions, it may be cumbersome to navigate through it.
