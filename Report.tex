\begin{abstract}
This document briefly describes how to write a technical report using \LaTeX.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}

This is the introduction to your report.  In this section you will tell the reader what you are going to say in the body.  If it is a long report, you might even sketch out what you will say, section by section.  Generally you will write the introduction and conclusions {\it after} the body.

\section{The Body--Background and Notation}
Here you will discuss your findings.  You will probably have multiple sections.  The first section will usually describe the {\it general} problem you are addressing, giving the reader some background and context for the coming sections.  You should also list any notation that is unusual or new.

\section{The Body--Problem Setup and Solution}

Once you have the background material complete, you should set up the problem you are solving and discuss what particular issues you are studying.  In the case of the LSI project, you should discuss what { \it specific } questions you will address and how you will find the answers.




\section{The Body--Computational Results}

In this section you should present your computational results and tell the reader your findings based on these results.  Be very specific here.  Also, the use of tables is a great idea in this section (as well as in other places) so you might put in something like this:


\section{Figures}

\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{0.25\textwidth}

\centering
\caption{\footnotesize This figure is drawn from a PDF file that 
was included, scaled and inserted into wrapped text.  Use the \LaTeX\ 
source as a starting point for inserting your own figures.}
\label{fig1}

\end{wrapfigure}
Inserting figures into \LaTeX\ documents can be complicated.  One strategy (which is a good general strategy for working with \LaTeX\ documents) is to refer to existing documents as templates for specific types of constructs.  For example, you can refer back to this document to see how Figure~\ref{fig1} is expressed in \LaTeX\ source code. Web searches are also an excellent resource for getting detailed information about \LaTeX\ strategies.  You don't have to struggle alone in trying to get \LaTeX\ to work!

\Code here{wrapfigure}{r}{0.25\textwidth}

\includegraphics[scale=0.1]{LaTeX_Lion.pdf}
\caption{\footnotesize This figure is drawn 
from a PDF file that was included, scaled 
and inserted into wrapped text.  Use the 
\LaTeX\ source as a starting point for 
inserting your own figures.}
\label{fig1}
\end{wrapfigure}
\end{verbatim}
\end{mdframed}
\caption{\footnotesize The \LaTeX\ source shown in this figure was used to generate Figure~\ref{fig1}.  Note that \LaTeX\ places figures for you.  You do not have direct control over figure placement, but can ``coach'' \LaTeX\ when you get some experience behind you.}
\label{fig2}
\end{figure}
Figure~\ref{fig2} shows the \LaTeX\ source that generated Figure~\ref{fig1}.


\section{The Conclusion}

Here you will synthesize what you have already said, bringing out the most relevant points and conclusions you have made, and explicitly making points that may have been implicit.  You may want to enumerate or list your conclusions.  If so you could do so as follows:


\begin{enumerate}
\item This is an enumerated list.
\item All items are listed with numbers.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{itemize}
\item This is an itemized list.
\item All items start with a bullet.
\begin{itemize}
\item Note:  It is possible to nest these lists.
\begin{enumerate}
\item To many depths.
\end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}


% This line is used to build the bibliography.  In this case, we use the 
% \bibliography command to include the file sample.bib, which contains our
% bibtex database.  The bibtex command (which our Latex IDE runs for us) processes
% our Latex document and scans our Bibtex file for matching citations, and then
% generates the bibligraphy based on the style selection we made at the top
% of the document.
