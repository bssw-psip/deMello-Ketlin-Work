The presentation exemplifies how the repository mining tool "Reposcanner" can be utilized to gather data on commits, issues, comments, and reactions on GitHub repositories, and how such information could be used to identify practices to aid collaboration between the Exascale Compute Project community. Key takeaways from the source include: a highly interconnected ecosystem of project teams actively make use of pull requests and issues, large teams, code tests, and examples all go together, as well as code examples attract collaborators, and lead to implementing automated build and test systems.},

      Insightful graphs within the presentation include "User and community engagement," "Reliance on an individual developer," "Hot topics based on issues," and "Changes on code complexity." This presentation helps guide understanding of how developers' behaviors impact the success of software productivity and sustainability.}

However, changes and computer architecture give rise to challenges on development productivity, product quality, development time, software sustainability, and evolving software capabilities.
    This report summarizes technical and cultural challenges in software productivity, sustainability and introduces work by IDEAS within ECP to foster and advance software development for extreme-scale environments. IDEAS goal is  comprised of four synergetic strategies: (1) Customize and curate methodologies, (2) Incrementally and iteratively improve software practices, (3) Establish software communities, (4) Engage in community outreach.}
